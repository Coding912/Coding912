    <strong><h1>The Cardiovascular System</h1></strong><br>
    <h3>What is the Cardiovascular System?</h3> 
    <p> The cardiovascular system is also known as the circulatory system. This body system consists of the heart, blood vessels and the heart. 
      The name cardiovascular refers to the (cardio)heart and (vascular)vessel system.</p><br>
      
      <h3> What Does This System do? </h3>
      <p>This system is needed in order to transport materials that your body needs like 
        oxygen and glucose to each cell in your body. It also removes waste products like carbon dioxide (a gas toxic to your body) out of your cells. 
        This system also transports white blood cells (WBC) around your body.</p><br>\
        
        <h3>What is the Heart?</h3>
        <p> The heart is a organ that is hollow and muscular. It is about the size of your fist and pumps blood throughout your body. Unlike the other 
          muscles in your body your heart is made out of cardiac muscle. This allows your heart to pump blood thoughout your body involuntarily. Your heart is a major organ
          because you need it to transport needed materials to your cells (like oxygen) and remove waste products (like carbon dioxide and urea) from you cells.
          All mammals have a 4 chambered heart. The names of these chambers are, the right atrium, the right ventricle the left atrium and the left ventricle.</p><br>

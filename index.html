    <strong><h1>The Cardiovascular System</h1></strong><br>
    <h3>What is the Cardiovascular System?</h3> 
    <p> The cardiovascular system is also known as the circulatory system. This body system consists of the heart, blood vessels and the heart. 
      The name cardiovascular refers to the (cardio)heart and (vascular)vessel system.</p><br>
      
      <h3> What Does This System do? </h3>
      <p>This system is needed in order to transport materials that your body needs like 
        oxygen and glucose to each cell in your body. It also removes waste products like carbon dioxide (a gas toxic to your body) out of your cells. 
        This system also transports white blood cells (WBC) around your body.</p><br>
        
        <h3>What is the Heart?</h3>
        <p> The heart is a organ that is hollow and muscular. It is about the size of your fist and pumps blood throughout your body. Unlike the other 
          muscles in your body your heart is made out of cardiac muscle. This allows your heart to pump blood thoughout your body involuntarily. Your heart is a major organ
          because you need it to transport needed materials to your cells (like oxygen) and remove waste products (like carbon dioxide and urea) from you cells.
          All mammals have a 4 chambered heart. The names of these chambers are, the right atrium, the right ventricle the left atrium and the left ventricle.</p><br>

      <h3>What are Arteries?</h3>
    <p> An artery is a thick muscular blood vessel carrying blood AWAY from the heart. 
      An artery normally carrys oxygenated blood. The pulmonary artery is the only exception because it carrys deoxygenated blood
      from the right ventricle to the to the lungs. They carry the blood to the lungs in order to remove the carbon dioxide and pick 
      up oxygen so that cells can do aerobic respiration. One of the most important artery is the aorta. It carrys blood from the
    left ventricle to the rest of the body. One unique feature arteries have is a pulse. A pulse is created by the 
    walls contracting and relaxing to push blood along.</p>

    <h3>What are veins</h3>
    <p> A vein is another blood vessel like an artery. However there are many differences. A vein carries blood TOWARDS the heart.
        A vein is also not muscular and doesn't have a pulse either. They have thin walls and some even have valves to prevent
      blood from going backwards. Most veins carry deoxygenated blood except the pulmonary veins. The pulmonary veins carry
      oxygenated blood from the lungs and brings it to the left atrium. Unlike the arteries the blood in the veins is under low
      pressure.</p>
    
    <h3> What are Capillaries</h3>
    <p> A capillary is a super thin blood vessel (1 cell thick). It is in the capillaries that diffusion and gas exchange occur.
      This is because of the thin walls it has. These thin blood vessels connect arteries and veins. Most blood vessels are 
      actually capillaries.</p>
